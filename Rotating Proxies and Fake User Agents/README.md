# Data Extraction using Newspaper3k by Rotating Proxies and Fake User Agents!  
### Jan’21 - Mar’21
A project performing basic data extraction by rotating proxy IP addresses and rotating user agents.  

## Overview
In this project, I am extracting data from 'dailymail.co.uk' by using the requests library to fetch raw HTML by using proxy IP addresses and rotating user agents. Here I will be using Newspaper3k to parse the raw HTML.

## Files required
Download the 'keyword.csv' through this link which contains 12000 random keywords.
